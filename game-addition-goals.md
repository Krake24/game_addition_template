Leverage all the cool things to do in our game\


* We have multiple fun activities for a player to do in-game (social encounters, combat encounters, missions, UGC(User Generated Content), etc.) but only give the player limited rewards or opportunities to engage with them, so it’s easy to forget about some.\

* We want to open up our game and give players more opportunities and reasons to engage with ALL the activities created and be reminded of some that may have been forgotten.

Give players greater impact and allow them to make strategic choices\


* Players frequently request more choices and impact in how they approach the game.

Strong world focused on lore\


* Players enjoy the world we’ve created and want this addition to improve that connection in a meaningful way.
