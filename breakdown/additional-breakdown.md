Addition Example

Grondal SPECIAL ABILITY (No Pain, No Gain)

Overview

The Grondal’s love of combat is only overshadowed by their love of food. Tribes of Grondal can be found across the planet, and although customs may vary between them, a few things remain the same: their young undergo a brutal procedure whereby the section of the brain that feels fear is cut away, implanted in its place is their “Fear Inhibitor Chip”. Fearless and constantly hungry, they will not stop until everyone in the arena is dead. Even if that also means them.

Mechanics The Grondal has 4 “modes” to his fear inhibitor chip.

* The player can change the mode that the chip is currently in by standing still and pressing dodge.
*
  * The only other functionality that dodge has is his belly bounce attack (dodge forward).
  * Left spinning attack (left dodge)
  * Right spinning attack (right dodge)
  * Rear spinning attack (rear dodge)
* By default the player starts in “normal mode”
* Pressing the dodge button once will move to “bold mode”
* Pressing again will move to “fearless mode”
* Pressing again will move to “zero fucks given mode”
* Pressing again will cycle back to “normal mode”. Below is an example of what the UI element would look like:

\
2\. Player presses the dodge button and the UI element shows the change to “bold”\
IF the player does not press the activation button again, after 1-2 seconds, the Grondal will play his “activate my head” animation, at which point the Grondal will enter his new idle animation for the “bold” mode.\


* SO, the player must leave the mode setting on the desired mode for 1-2 seconds before the Grondal plays his activate mode animation and actually changes mode.
* a. This will allow the player to cycle through modes quickly without triggering the actual modes.
* b. SO, if the player is in default mode and presses the activation button one, two, three, four times and releases the button, nothing will happen because they will be back to the default setting.
